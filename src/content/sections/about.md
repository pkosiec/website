# Hi. I'm Pawe≈Ç Kosiec.

I'm a&nbsp;Full-stack Cloud Developer located in Gliwice, Poland.

Currently I&nbsp;work at SAP Labs, where I&nbsp;develop [Kyma](https://kyma-project.io), an open source project. I&nbsp;write back-end services in **Go**, and modern front-ends using **JavaScript** (React.js). I&nbsp;work in cloud-native environment, associated with microservices and extending **Kubernetes**.

I am both [Certified Kubernetes Application Developer](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/4ef650a8-2c5d-48df-bdc7-d7bafdd9e4ec) and [Certified Kubernetes Administrator](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/32059797-c35c-4c49-bcc3-d27268a530df).

In 2018 I&nbsp;have completed a&nbsp;master's in Computer Science at Silesian University of Technology.

I'm open source and cloud-native enthusiast. That's why I'm a&nbsp;co-organizer of the&nbsp;[Gophers Silesia](https://www.meetup.com/GophersSilesia) meetup, which is a&nbsp;local community interested in Go & cloud-native topics.
